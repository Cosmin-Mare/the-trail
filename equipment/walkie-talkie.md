# Jack and Bluetooth Walkie Talkie

**Team Members (1-4 suggested):**
@Cosmin-Mare, but I am looking for team members if there's anyone interested

**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):**
This is my first ever PCB that I build(except hacker card), and I'm so excited to build this and to see everyone use it

**What you are making?**
I'm making a Walkie Talkie with bluetooth and a jack cable incorporated, so you can talk to your trail-mates even when you don't want someone else to hear you or you need to be quiet.
This is super useful because there will be times where you want to talk to someone and they're not near you, and because we probably won't have wifi on the whole trail(but even if we do, walkie talkies are cook), and we have to talk to each other over large distances. I also want to make this as compact as possible.

**Inspiration:**
Some inspo I had on this is that I once went on a guided tour through Rome and the guide gave us all walkie talkies through which he spoke and they had a jack slot which was soooo convenient beacuse we could just not listen to him if we wanted to lol, but also we weren't annoying people who didn't want to hear what he was saying

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**
